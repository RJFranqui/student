I am Skye Nidiffer and I am a senior majoring in computer science. I just finished my first internship over the summer doing mainframe software development and I really enjoyed it. I also finished COSC370 over the summer so I'm glad to hear some of that course will prepare me for this course. I'm looking forward to learning more about different kinds of data analysis methods and techniques in this course. As for non-technical interests, I also like video games and art/crafts.
