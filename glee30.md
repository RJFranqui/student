My name is Griffin Lee; I'm a senior here at UT. I have experience from Procter and Gamble where I interned in supply chain and worked with large databases to create real-time tracking tools. I enjoy data analysis and learning about AI; I will be working for P&G for supply chain analytics post-grad, so I took this class to learn skills about using data that I can take with me to my career.
