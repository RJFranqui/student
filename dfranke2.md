My name is Dillon Frankenstein and I am a senior computer science student working in Dr. Zhao's lab. I am interested in machine learning and robotics, so I hope to gain a more complete understanding by taking this course. I am quite excited to delve deeper 
into the topics mentioned in the course description. My passions lie within understanding new topics fully, so this seemed like the perfect course to take.
