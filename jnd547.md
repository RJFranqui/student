I am Jonathan Tran and I am a senior undergrad here at UTK. I am majoring in CS. I am interested in ML, Data Science, and Cybersecurity. I am also willing to learn anything new. I have some experience with web development.
In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, watching anime, reading, biking, and working out. I hope to be able to learn more about data and gain more experience working with data from this class.
