I am Ethan Maness and I am a graduate student pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science.
I also work as a graduate research assistant at TENNLab where I research neuromorphic computing under my advisor, Dr. Catherine Schuman.
Besides machine learning, I also have an interest in software engineering, which I participate in through the student organization Hack4Impact.
In my free time, I enjoy writing mods for video games, trying new foods, and listening to alternative rock.
