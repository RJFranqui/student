# Introduction
I am Brent Maples. I grew up in Knoxville, TN and started my college career as Exploratory before venturing into Mathematics. Afterwards, I exposed myself to Computer Science by doin personal projects, trying to automate things in my own life. After realizing the power that coding could have in my own life, I set out to be a CS major. Thus, I became a CS major andhave had the opportunity in many internships to create software that automates daily processes. As for personal interests, I enjoy reading and doing things that will help me become a well-rounded individual.
