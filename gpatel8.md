I am Ghanshyam Patel and I am an undergraduate senior in Computer Science. I would like to work in software development after graduating. I'm interested in software development, whether it's backend, frontend, etc. I've had internships where I've worked in backend console development and Mobile development. My hobbies include watching TV or basketball and working out. I would like to learn more about data science in this course, mainly with web scrapping and data manipulation.
