What you want to get out of the course?: Hello! My name is Margaret Kelley, my netID is mkelle37. I have worked at as TA here at UTK for four semesters and am also now doing undergraduate research for Dr. Ruoti. I am hoping this class will be able to help me understand data better as we will be using LLM models in our research. I have never taken a class like this before so I am extremely excited to take a course like this and learn about data! This also counts as a credit towards my BS degree, cyber security minor, and MS degree.
