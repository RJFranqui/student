Hello! I am Diego Ferrer and I am a Computer Engineering MS Student at UTK. I am currently doing the thesis option under Dr. Admedullah Aziz with a research focus in ML-based Compact Modeling. I have always liked the idea of having a profession that allowed me to use computers and I have come to enjoy programming as well as learning more about how computers work. As for my hobbies, I like reading and video games with my friends.
