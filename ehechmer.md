Hey! My name is Braden Hechmer and I'm a student here at the University of Tennessee. I'm currently working as a Product Manager at a startup focusing on connecting skilled workers with critical manufacturing jobs. I'm passionate about machine learning, algorithms, and problem-solving. I'm excited about taking this course and hoping to learn more about data manipulation and create a cool project along the way.
