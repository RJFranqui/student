I am Vincent Broda and I am a Masters student in CS. I am intrested in AI and Parallel computing but am very open to learning about all sorts of subjects. I am hoping to learn more about how to deal with data in this course. Based on a bit of the descriptions I have read in the github it seems like this will be a nice way to learn about how to deal with bigger and messy data as well as possibly how to collect it.
