Hi, I'm Casey Stefanick. I'm a senior and I have been at UT for almost three years now. I have been interested in software and web development
ever since I started coding my senior year of high school. I've had a few internships that have solidified my interest in software development. 
I'm hoping this class further develops my data management and analysis skills, to be applied in real-world situations.
