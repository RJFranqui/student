I am Nolan Coffey and I am a senior undergraduate computer science major. I have some prior experience webscraping, and performing data analysis and visualization, but I'm excited to learn more. I am looking forward to learning techniques for cleaning data and how that will synergize with the Natural Language Processing class I'm taking this semester.
