I am Fort Hunter and I am a senior computer science student here at UTK.  I have worked at Southern Company for the last couple of years and I plan to pursue a career in software development after graduation.  My main interestes are software development and machine learning.  I hope to gain knowledge in the field of data science from this class.  Outside of school and work I enjoy running, watching movies, and cooking.
