I am Blake Milstead and I am a 4th year undergraduate at the University of Tennessee. I am an undergraduate research assistant at a high performance computing lab lead by Michela Taufer called the Global Computing Lab (GCL). My academic interests include AI/ML, machine learning, and particle physics. I hope to get more experience with data analysis and data collection for my research with this course.
