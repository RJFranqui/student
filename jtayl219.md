I am Joseph Taylor, but I go by my middle name Riley. I am an undergraduate senior in computer science. I am also an undergraduate research assistant working with OpenAI's GPT model to simulate a realistic therapist to assist cognitively impaired seniors. I am interested in learning new things related to the field of computer science in order to find out what I am passionate about and what I want to pursue as a career path.
