Hello, my name is Ryan Peruski, and I am a senior in CS taking this class. I have a lot of experience in Python data analysis with various classes here at UT, and I have some experience in Machine Learning from my internship at ORNL and my research over the past summer. I find the process of collecting and cleaning data systematically to be very interesting, and I want to get into Data Science in the future.
