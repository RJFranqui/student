I am Mikayla McCormack, a current undergrad senior, studying computer science with a minor in business administration. I enjoy coding in 
languages such as JavaScript, HTML, React, etc., and doing more front-end web development. I'm taking this class because I needed an 
elective and I haven't worked much with data science. I thought it'd be an interesting area to explore and get familiar with. I don't 
know if I'd like to do this in my future career, but having the skill set will be useful.
