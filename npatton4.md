I am Nolan Patton and I am a computer science major. I've been taking coding courses since elementary school, including AP Computer Science in high school, because I've always wanted to learn software development. My dream is to make video games and so far I've published a few small demos and minigames (plus a couple other small projects, like a Discord bot). Most of my coding experience is in Python and C++, and I have a bit of experience developing in the Godot game engine.
