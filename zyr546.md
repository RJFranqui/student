I am Austin Smith and I am a senior studying Computer Science here at UTK. I am most interested in cybersecurity, but I have an interest in all types of development including front-end and back-end. I just spent a summer working at AutoZone in IT learning front-end programming, especially the React language. The idea of Digital Archaeology sounds both foreign but also very exciting to me and I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester.
