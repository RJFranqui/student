I am Jonathan Clark and I am an undergraduate senior computer science major. I took bioinformatics last year wherein my group's final project included analysing a series of different 
strains of malaria and E. coli and comparing them to one another. I hope to spend this class performing analysis and visualization of a similar kind.
