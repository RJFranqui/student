My name is John Kutbay, and I am a senior majoring in computer science. I would like to work in software development after attaining my degree. I enjoy playing soccer in my free time with the UTK club team as well as in my hometown sunday league. Furthermore, I like playing video games with my friends. I would like to learn more about operations within software and the impact it can have with minimal changes. I would also like to use real projects to understand this more in-depth.
