Hey there! My name is Justin Henley and I am a senior studying Neuroscience and Computer Science! My goal is to continue on after undergraduate to medical school where I dream of becoming a neurologist. I believe that this course will help me increase my practical skills of data analysis which may be useful when I am a doctor. I am very involved with the Greek life scene on campus and tend to spend most of my free time in various leadership roles there.
