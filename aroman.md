I am Anthony Roman and I am a graduate student in Computer Science. I am also GTA for COSC 100 (Introduction to Computers and Computing).
I enjoy coding as well as learning about a multitude of different subjects within computer science. I hope to learn a lot more about data
science from this class especially because it interests me as well as it seems to be very useful to have knowledge in.
