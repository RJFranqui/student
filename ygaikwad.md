I am Yashraj Gaikwad and I'm a masters student, currently in my final year. 
At present, I'm working as a web developer for the Tennessee Reading Research Center. 
I'm also interested in game development as well. 
From this course I'm interested mainly in how to deal with operational data and the techniques associated with it.
