## About Me

My name is William (Will) Duff and I am a senior undergrad student.
I have done web scraping before in CS 340, and I have done some data analytics and management in a previous internship.
I really enjoy software engineering and I hope that this course provides useful insights that expand my software engineering knowledge.
