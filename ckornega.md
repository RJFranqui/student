I am Caleb Kornegay. I am a senior in Computer Science at UTK. I worked in industry at Siemens Healthineers last semester on a Co-op. I enjoy programming, gaming, music, working out, and hiking. I took this class to learn digital forensics which is a useful skill for penetration testing which is something I am interested in getting better at.
