I am Isha Bhandari, and I am a senior pursuing a Computer Science degree with a minor in Leadership Studies. I have had two internships at the Oak Ridge National Lab in software development research and one internship at Dell Technologies in hardware validation. I am not sure exactly what I am interested in in the future career-wise. However, I know I want to make a big positive social impact and want to know that I'm improving lives everyday. Through this course, I would like to learn more about a field in computer science that I may want to pursue after graduation. I do not know much about digital archaeology, so I would like to learn almost anything about it. Outside of school, I'm very interested in concerts/music, Pilates, pickleball, walking my dog, and anything mental health-related.
