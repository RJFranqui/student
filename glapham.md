What I want out of this course is to learn how to scrape and sort through data, as I feel it is an important skill to have for any potential jobs I will have in the future. Data science is 
a very plentiful field to go into, and I am hoping to have the opportuniity to work in that field once I graduate this year. If it turns out I'm not a fan of data science,
at least I'll get to find out!
